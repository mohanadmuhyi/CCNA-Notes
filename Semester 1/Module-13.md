# 🛰️ Module 13: ICMP

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explain how ICMP is used to test network connectivity.
* Use **ping** and **traceroute** to verify and troubleshoot networks.

## 📘 13.1 ICMP Messages

### 📡 What is ICMP?

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network layer protocol used by devices to send **error messages** and **operational information**.

* **ICMPv4**: For IPv4 networks
* **ICMPv6**: For IPv6 networks (adds more functionality)

### 📬 Common ICMP Message Types

| Purpose                         | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Host Reachability               | Uses Echo Request and Echo Reply to check if a host is reachable         |
| Destination/Service Unreachable | Notifies the source when a destination/service cannot be reached         |
| Time Exceeded                   | Notifies when a packet's TTL or Hop Limit reaches 0 (used in traceroute) |

> 🔒 **Security Note**: ICMP messages may be blocked in networks for security reasons.

### 📩 Destination Unreachable Codes

* **ICMPv4**:

  * 0: Net unreachable
  * 1: Host unreachable
  * 2: Protocol unreachable
  * 3: Port unreachable
* **ICMPv6**:

  * 0: No route to destination
  * 1: Communication administratively prohibited (e.g., firewall)
  * 2: Beyond scope of source address
  * 3: Address unreachable
  * 4: Port unreachable

### ⌛ Time Exceeded

* **ICMPv4**: TTL = 0 triggers a Time Exceeded message.
* **ICMPv6**: Hop Limit = 0 triggers a similar message.

### 🧠 ICMPv6 Special Features

ICMPv6 includes **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)**:

| Message Type                | Use                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Router Solicitation (RS)    | Ask routers to advertise themselves                   |
| Router Advertisement (RA)   | Sent by routers with address info (prefix, DNS, etc.) |
| Neighbor Solicitation (NS)  | Request for MAC address or DAD                        |
| Neighbor Advertisement (NA) | Response with MAC address or address conflict         |

> 🧪 **Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)**: An IPv6 device uses NS to check if its address is already in use. If another responds with NA, the address is in conflict.

> 💡 **Address Resolution**: Uses NS/NA messages (like ARP for IPv6).

## 📘 13.2 Ping and Traceroute Tests

### 🧪 Ping Utility

Tests **connectivity** between two devices using ICMP Echo Request/Reply.

* Used with both IPv4 and IPv6
* Shows packet loss and round-trip time
* May timeout at first due to ARP/ND resolution

#### Use Cases

| Purpose              | Address                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Test internal TCP/IP | `127.0.0.1` or `::1`        |
| Test local network   | Default gateway             |
| Test remote network  | Public host (e.g., 8.8.8.8) |

> 🔒 ICMP may be **blocked by firewalls**, resulting in no reply despite successful delivery.

### 🌐 Traceroute Utility

Maps the path from source to destination by incrementing TTL/Hop Limit:

| TTL Value | Behavior                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1         | Times out at first router → ICMP Time Exceeded message |
| 2         | Times out at second router, and so on                  |

* IPv4 uses **TTL**
* IPv6 uses **Hop Limit**
* Shows response time at each hop
* Uses asterisks (\*) to indicate timeouts

> 🔧 Helps locate unreachable or slow segments in the network

## 🧠 Additional Notes for NetAcad Questions

### ✅ Common to Both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6

* **Destination or Service Unreachable**
* **Time Exceeded**

### ✅ ICMPv6-Specific Behavior

* **Router Solicitation (RS)** is sent by hosts to request configuration
* ICMPv6 provides **autoconfiguration** features via RS and RA messages

## 🌟 Final Words

ICMP is essential for **connectivity testing**, **path discovery**, and **network troubleshooting**. Whether using **ping** for quick checks or **traceroute** to map your route, understanding ICMP helps keep networks resilient and easier to manage.
