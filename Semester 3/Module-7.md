## 7.1 üìå Purpose of WANs

### üñ•Ô∏è LANs vs. WANs

* **LAN (Local Area Network):**

  * Small geographic area (home, office, campus).
  * Owned & managed by an organization/home.
  * High bandwidth using Ethernet & Wi-Fi.
  * No recurring fees beyond infrastructure.
  * **Use case:** Connecting PCs, printers, servers locally.
* **WAN (Wide Area Network):**

  * Large geographic coverage (city, country, worldwide).
  * Owned & managed by providers (ISP, telco, satellite, cable).
  * Requires subscription fees.
  * Bandwidth ranges from low to very high.
  * WiMAX is designed for WAN (unlike Wi-Fi which is LAN only).
  * **Use case:** Connecting remote offices, users, or branches over large distances.

### üîí Private vs. Public WANs

* **Private WAN:**

  * Dedicated to one customer.
  * Guaranteed service level, consistent bandwidth, secure.
  * Example: MPLS leased service from a provider.
* **Public WAN:**

  * Shared over Internet (ISP-based).
  * Variable service & bandwidth, lower cost.
  * Example: Business broadband Internet.

### üï∏Ô∏è WAN Topologies

* **Point-to-Point:** One-to-one link between sites (transparent to customer, costly at scale).
* **Hub-and-Spoke:** Central hub router connects multiple spokes (simple, but hub is a single point of failure).
* **Dual-Homed:** Hub has two connections for redundancy/load balancing (costlier, requires complex configuration).
* **Full Mesh:** All sites connect to each other (highest redundancy, expensive).
* **Partial Mesh:** Some but not all sites interconnect (balance of cost & resiliency).

### üì° Carrier Connections

* **Single Carrier:** One service provider + SLA.
* **Dual Carrier:** Two providers for redundancy + higher availability.

### üìà Evolving Networks Example (SPAN Engineering)

* **Small Network:** LAN with DSL connection, wireless router, outsourced IT.
* **Campus Network (CAN):** Multiple floors/buildings, firewall, in-house IT staff.
* **Branch Network (MAN):** Interconnect city offices using dedicated lines.
* **Distributed Network:** Global WAN using VPNs (site-to-site & remote).
