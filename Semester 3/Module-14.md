## ‚öôÔ∏è 14.1 Automation Overview

### ü§ñ Automation Everywhere

Automation is all around us ‚Äî from self-service checkouts to self-driving cars.

**Benefits of Automation:**

* Machines work 24/7 without breaks.
* Provides consistent output.
* Enables quick data collection and analysis.
* Reduces human risk in dangerous environments.
* Smart devices can adapt behavior for efficiency and safety.

### üß† Thinking Devices

* Devices that act based on input or environment are called **smart devices**.
* Smart devices use **network automation tools** for programming and decision-making.

## üíæ 14.2 Data Formats

### üìò Concept

Data formats are structures for storing and exchanging data. Common formats include:

* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
* **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**
* **YAML (YAML Ain‚Äôt Markup Language)**

Each format has specific **syntax**, **structure**, and **key/value rules**.

### üß© JSON Format

* Human-readable and widely used in APIs.
* Uses braces `{}` for objects and brackets `[]` for arrays.
* Written as **key/value pairs**.

**Syntax Rules:**

* Keys are strings in double quotes.
* Values can be strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, or objects.
* Multiple pairs separated by commas.
* Arrays use `[ ]` and are ordered lists.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "addresses": [
    {"ip": "172.16.0.2", "netmask": "255.255.255.0"},
    {"ip": "172.16.0.3", "netmask": "255.255.255.0"}
  ]
}
```

### üßæ YAML Format

* Superset of JSON, more human-friendly.
* Uses **indentation**, not brackets or commas.
* Key-value pairs separated by a colon `:`.
* Lists use hyphens `-`.

**Example:**

```yaml
ietf-interfaces:interface:
  name: GigabitEthernet2
  enabled: true
  ietf-ip:ipv4:
    address:
      - ip: 172.16.0.2
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
      - ip: 172.16.0.3
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
```

### XML Format

* Similar to HTML; uses custom tags.
* Data is enclosed in `<tag>value</tag>`.

**Example:**

```xml
<interface>
  <name>GigabitEthernet2</name>
  <enabled>true</enabled>
  <ipv4>
    <address>
      <ip>172.16.0.2</ip>
      <netmask>255.255.255.0</netmask>
    </address>
  </ipv4>
</interface>
```

## üîó 14.3 APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

### üß† Concept

* An **API** allows applications to interact and exchange data/services.
* Works like a **waiter**: takes a request and delivers a response.

### üçΩÔ∏è API Types

1. **Open/Public APIs** ‚Äì accessible to everyone (often need a free key).
2. **Internal/Private APIs** ‚Äì for internal use within a company.
3. **Partner APIs** ‚Äì shared between trusted partners (e.g., airlines and travel sites).

### üåç Types of Web Service APIs

| Type     | Data Format     | Strength                |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| SOAP     | XML             | Established, structured |
| REST     | JSON, XML, YAML | Most common, flexible   |
| XML-RPC  | XML             | Simple, legacy          |
| JSON-RPC | JSON            | Simple, modern          |

---

## üåê 14.4 REST (Representational State Transfer)

### üí° REST Basics

* REST APIs use **HTTP/HTTPS** for communication.
* Operate via **requests** and **responses**.
* RESTful means it follows REST principles:

  * **Client-Server** separation.
  * **Stateless** communication.
  * **Cacheable** for performance.

### üß∞ RESTful HTTP Methods (CRUD)

| Method    | Operation |
| --------- | --------- |
| POST      | Create    |
| GET       | Read      |
| PUT/PATCH | Update    |
| DELETE    | Delete    |

### üåé URI, URN, and URL

* **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):** General identifier for a resource. Example ‚Üí `https://example.com/book.html`.
* **URN (Uniform Resource Name):** Identifies a resource by name, not location. Example ‚Üí `urn:isbn:0451450523`.
* **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** Specifies the location of the resource. Example ‚Üí `https://www.example.com/images/logo.png`.

### üîç Parts of a URL

A typical URL consists of:

1. **Protocol/Scheme:** Defines communication method (e.g., `https`, `ftp`).
2. **Hostname:** The domain name or IP (e.g., `www.example.com`).
3. **Path:** Specifies the location or file (e.g., `/author/book.html`).
4. **Fragment:** Optional identifier within a page (e.g., `#page155`).

**Full Example:** `https://www.example.com/author/book.html#page155`

### üî¢ Details of a Query String

Queries are used to send information to the server within the URL. They contain:

1. **Format:** Defines data type requested (e.g., `outFormat=json`).
2. **Key:** Authorization token or API key (e.g., `key=123ABC`).
3. **Parameters:** Custom data for the request (e.g., `from=San+Jose,CA&to=Monterey,CA`).

### üåê Example RESTful Request

```
https://www.mapquestapi.com/directions/v2/route?key=KEY&from=San+Jose,CA&to=Monterey,CA&outFormat=json
```

* **API Server:** mapquestapi.com
* **Resource:** directions API
* **Query:** contains key, format, and parameters.

### üß™ RESTful API Tools

* **Web Browser:** run GET requests directly.
* **Postman:** test REST APIs.
* **Python:** automate API calls.
* **Network OS:** NETCONF, RESTCONF for network configuration.

## üß† 14.5 Configuration Management Tools

### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Traditional Configuration

* Previously done manually via CLI.
* Time-consuming and error-prone.

### üß© Modern Network Automation

* Uses APIs and protocols (REST, JSON, XML, Python, etc.) to manage devices at scale.

### üß± Agentless Architecture (Ansible)

* **Agentless** means no software agent is installed on managed devices.
* The **controller** connects remotely (e.g., via SSH or HTTPS) and executes configuration changes.
* Reduces complexity, increases security, and makes deployment easier.
* Example: **Ansible** communicates directly without agents, ideal for heterogeneous networks.

### üõ†Ô∏è Automation vs Orchestration

* **Automation** ‚Üí Tool performs a task automatically.
* **Orchestration** ‚Üí Coordinates multiple automated tasks into workflows.

### ‚öíÔ∏è Popular Tools

| Tool          | Language      | Agent       | Controller    | Output   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| **Ansible**   | Python + YAML | Agentless   | Any device    | Playbook |
| **Chef**      | Ruby          | Agent-based | Chef Master   | Cookbook |
| **Puppet**    | Ruby          | Both        | Puppet Master | Manifest |
| **SaltStack** | Python        | Both        | Salt Master   | Pillar   |
